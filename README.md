# TensorFlow---Object-Detection-Project

The TensorFlow Object Detection project tests objects in photos and videos using various pre-trained models. To use the program, you need to run the `run_me.py` file.

Place the photos or videos you want to test in the "test" folder, and change the file location of the desired image in the `run_me.py` file (for example: `imagePath = "test/2.jpg"`).

To run the program, you need to install TensorFlow in your environment.
