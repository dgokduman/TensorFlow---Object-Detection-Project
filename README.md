# TensorFlow--Object-Detection-Project

  The TensorFlow Object Detection project tests objects in photos and videos using various pre-trained models. To use the program, you need to run the `run_me.py` file.
  The main TensorFlow function codes are in the `Detector.py` file.

Place the photos or videos you want to test in the "test" folder (Currently, there are already several videos an images in the folder.), and change the file location of the desired image in the `run_me.py` file (for example: `imagePath = "test/2.jpg"`).

To run the program, you need to install TensorFlow in your environment.
